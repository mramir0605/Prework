### ðŸš€ App Idea: Mood Color  

Iâ€™d like to create an iOS app called **Hydration Tracker**. The idea is that tapping a button instantly changes the screen background to a random color. Users could save their favorite shades, view a color history, and even share colors with friends.  

Planned features include:  
to help users stay properly hydrated throughout the day. The app allows users to log their water intake, set reminders, and track daily, weekly, or monthly progress with visual charts.  

**Planned features:**  
- Quick log button to record water intake (e.g., 8 oz, 12 oz, custom amount)  
- Daily goal tracker with visual progress bar  
- Custom reminders to drink water at set intervals  
- History log to review daily, weekly, and monthly hydration trends  
- Optional motivational messages and achievements  


## Notes

- One challenge I encountered while building the app was creating the IBAction. When I followed the steps, Xcode created an IBOutlet instead of an IBAction.
